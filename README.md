🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning regression techniques. It involves end-to-end model building—starting from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by training and evaluating multiple regression models, and finally visualizing the predictions.

📊 Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Leveraged Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore relationships between variables and uncover hidden trends.
