House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict house prices based on key features like area, number of bedrooms, and location. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📊 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

Feature selection and preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding categorical data, scaling)

Regression models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score

Model comparison and visualization of predictions

Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

Seaborn, Matplotlib – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning
